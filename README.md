# Beer Analysis Project

Namaste All! In this Repository I have created several machine Learning based models for beer quality analysis
The objective of this repository includes:
1. Feature Engineering of Dependent Variables in Beer Dataset
2. Create both categorical and regressive models
3. Analyse performance of various models

Dataset used in the project is available in repository. Characteristics and overview of dataset is as follow:

Features:

Describe the features or variables used in the analysis.
Explain what each feature represents and its significance in the analysis.
Data Preprocessing:

Outline the steps taken to preprocess the data, including:
Handling missing values
Encoding categorical variables
Scaling/normalizing numerical features
Splitting the data into training and testing sets
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Summarize the insights gained from exploratory data analysis, such as:
Distribution of target variable
Correlation between features
Any interesting patterns or trends observed in the data
